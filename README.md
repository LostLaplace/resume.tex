# resume.tex
Yet another LaTeX Résumé for software engineers.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you either have (1) a text editor where you can edit LaTeX and the corresponding TeX distribution for your OS to compile it into a PDF or (2) access to a site where you can edit and compile LaTeX. Additionally, you should have some basic knowledge of LaTeX syntax. If this is your first time with LaTeX, I highly recommend trying these tutorials to get familiar with [how it works](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes).

This tutorial will not cover how to write an effective resume. Try to have your resume content prepared, so you can follow along with the tutorial. A good starting point is this guide for writing a good resume by [a Technical Recruiter at Tesla](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vQpvbP8lzPvZrNvrX58UlacpQiLgh1fBQYfOS2pEJZvp-zOb9uKQJYKSsDQ6mJWoPf3H09OmdrLDcaK/pub).

## Introduction
Creating and updating a resume can be difficult. There are many word processing software options to choose from, like Microsoft Word and Google Docs. It’s very hard to find a good template and make adjustments some combination of the margins, font size, and line spacing to get all the resume content to fit the page just right. Keeping track of multiple versions of your resume is difficult and redundant.

LaTeX is an excellent solution to all of these problems! LaTeX is used as a professional typesetting system that is free to use and runs on any system or even online with Overleaf and works great to typeset your resume.

## Experience
Each of your listed work experiences should include 3-5 detailed and concise achievement statements that describe **WHAT** you did, **WHY** you did it, and what was the **IMPACT**. Here are a few things you should remember to include and focus on:
- **Be Detailed**: Instead of using generic statements, explain your achievements in detail. E.g., "Input data into database" vs. "Performed data entry of hard-copy financial statements into Salesforce Sales Cloud".
- **Data**: Use numbers and percentages to showcase the quantified impact that your task had. E.g., "Increased revenue" vs. "Increased revenue by 15%".

Focus on tailoring your resume to the specific position you are applying to instead of listing everything you have ever done.

## Verbs
Action verbs are utilized at the **beginning** of each of your experience bullet points. They showcase your impact, demonstrate your work ethic, and introduce your accomplishments.
